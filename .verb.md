## Quickstart

```js
const micromatch = require('micromatch');
// micromatch(list, patterns[, options]);
```

The [main export](#micromatch) takes a list of strings and one or more glob patterns:

```js
console.log(micromatch(['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux'], ['f*', 'b*'])) //=> ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
console.log(micromatch(['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux'], ['*', '!b*'])) //=> ['foo', 'qux']
```

Use [.isMatch()](#ismatch) to for boolean matching:

```js
console.log(micromatch.isMatch('foo', 'f*')) //=> true
console.log(micromatch.isMatch('foo', ['b*', 'f*'])) //=> true
```

[Switching](#switching-to-micromatch) from minimatch and multimatch is easy!

## Why use micromatch?

> micromatch is a [replacement](#switching-to-micromatch) for minimatch and multimatch

- Supports all of the same matching features as [minimatch][] and [multimatch][]
- More complete support for the Bash 4.3 specification than minimatch and multimatch. Micromatch passes _all of the spec tests_ from bash, including some that bash still fails.
- **Fast & Performant** - Loads in about 5ms and performs [fast matches](#benchmarks).
- **Glob matching** - Using wildcards (`*` and `?`), globstars (`**`) for nested directories
- **[Advanced globbing](#extended-globbing)** - Supports [extglobs](#extglobs), [braces](#braces-1), and [POSIX brackets](#posix-bracket-expressions), and support for escaping special characters with `\` or quotes.
- **Accurate** - Covers more scenarios [than minimatch](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/3339)
- **Well tested** - More than 5,000 [test assertions](./test)
- **Windows support** - More reliable windows support than minimatch and multimatch.
- **[Safe][braces]{#braces-is-safe}** - Micromatch is not subject to DoS with brace patterns like minimatch and multimatch.


### Matching features

* Support for multiple glob patterns (no need for wrappers like multimatch)
* Wildcards (`**`, `*.js`)
* Negation (`'!a/*.js'`, `'*!(b).js'`)
* [extglobs](#extglobs) (`+(x|y)`, `!(a|b)`)
* [POSIX character classes](#posix-bracket-expressions) (`[[:alpha:][:digit:]]`)
* [brace expansion][braces] (`foo/{1..5}.md`, `bar/{a,b,c}.js`)
* regex character classes (`foo-[1-5].js`)
* regex logical "or" (`foo/(abc|xyz).js`)

You can mix and match these features to create whatever patterns you need!

## Switching to micromatch

_(There is one notable difference between micromatch and minimatch in regards to how backslashes are handled. See [the notes about backslashes](#backslashes) for more information.)_

### From minimatch

Use [micromatch.isMatch()](#ismatch) instead of `minimatch()`:

```js
console.log(micromatch.isMatch('foo', 'b*')); //=> false
```

Use [micromatch.match()](#match) instead of `minimatch.match()`:

```js
console.log(micromatch.match(['foo', 'bar'], 'b*')); //=> 'bar'
```

### From multimatch

Same signature:

```js
console.log(micromatch(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], ['f*', '*z'])); //=> ['foo', 'baz']
```

## Options

| **Option** | **Type** | **Default value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `basename`            | `boolean`      | `false`     | If set, then patterns without slashes will be matched against the basename of the path if it contains slashes.  For example, `a?b` would match the path `/xyz/123/acb`, but not `/xyz/acb/123`. |
| `bash`                | `boolean`      | `false`     | Follow bash matching rules more strictly - disallows backslashes as escape characters, and treats single stars as globstars (`**`). |
| `capture`             | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Return regex matches in supporting methods. |
| `contains`            | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Allows glob to match any part of the given string(s). |
| `cwd`                 | `string`       | `process.cwd()` | Current working directory. Used by `picomatch.split()` |
| `debug`               | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Debug regular expressions when an error is thrown. |
| `dot`                 | `boolean`      | `false`     | Match dotfiles. Otherwise dotfiles are ignored unless a `.` is explicitly defined in the pattern. |
| `expandRange`         | `function`     | `undefined` | Custom function for expanding ranges in brace patterns, such as `{a..z}`. The function receives the range values as two arguments, and it must return a string to be used in the generated regex. It's recommended that returned strings be wrapped in parentheses. This option is overridden by the `expandBrace` option. |
| `failglob`            | `boolean`      | `false`     | Similar to the `failglob` behavior in Bash, throws an error when no matches are found. Based on the bash option of the same name. |
| `fastpaths`           | `boolean`      | `true`      | To speed up processing, full parsing is skipped for a handful common glob patterns. Disable this behavior by setting this option to `false`. |
| `flags`               | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Regex flags to use in the generated regex. If defined, the `nocase` option will be overridden. |
| [format](#optionsformat) | `function` | `undefined` | Custom function for formatting the returned string. This is useful for removing leading slashes, converting Windows paths to Posix paths, etc. |
| `ignore`              | `array|string` | `undefined` | One or more glob patterns for excluding strings that should not be matched from the result. |
| `keepQuotes`          | `boolean`      | `false`     | Retain quotes in the generated regex, since quotes may also be used as an alternative to backslashes.  |
| `literalBrackets`     | `boolean`      | `undefined` | When `true`, brackets in the glob pattern will be escaped so that only literal brackets will be matched. |
| `lookbehinds`         | `boolean`      | `true`      | Support regex positive and negative lookbehinds. Note that you must be using Node 8.1.10 or higher to enable regex lookbehinds. |
| `matchBase`           | `boolean`      | `false`     | Alias for `basename` |
| `maxLength`           | `boolean`      | `65536`     | Limit the max length of the input string. An error is thrown if the input string is longer than this value. |
| `nobrace`             | `boolean`      | `false`     | Disable brace matching, so that `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` would be treated as literal characters. |
| `nobracket`           | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Disable matching with regex brackets. |
| `nocase`              | `boolean`      | `false`     | Perform case-insensitive matching. Equivalent to the regex `i` flag. Note that this option is ignored when the `flags` option is defined. |
| `nodupes`             | `boolean`      | `true`      | Deprecated, use `nounique` instead. This option will be removed in a future major release. By default duplicates are removed. Disable uniquification by setting this option to false. |
| `noext`               | `boolean`      | `false`     | Alias for `noextglob` |
| `noextglob`           | `boolean`      | `false`     | Disable support for matching with [extglobs](#extglobs) (like `+(a|b)`) |
| `noglobstar`          | `boolean`      | `false`     | Disable support for matching nested directories with globstars (`**`) |
| `nonegate`            | `boolean`      | `false`     | Disable support for negating with leading `!` |
| `noquantifiers`       | `boolean`      | `false`     | Disable support for regex quantifiers (like `a{1,2}`) and treat them as brace patterns to be expanded. |
| [onIgnore](#optionsonIgnore) | `function` | `undefined` | Function to be called on ignored items. |
| [onMatch](#optionsonMatch) | `function` | `undefined` | Function to be called on matched items. |
| [onResult](#optionsonResult) | `function` | `undefined` | Function to be called on all items, regardless of whether or not they are matched or ignored. |
| `posix`               | `boolean`      | `false`     | Support [POSIX character classes](#posix-bracket-expressions) ("posix brackets"). |
| `posixSlashes`        | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Convert all slashes in file paths to forward slashes. This does not convert slashes in the glob pattern itself |
| `prepend`             | `string`       | `undefined` | String to prepend to the generated regex used for matching. |
| `regex`               | `boolean`      | `false`     | Use regular expression rules for `+` (instead of matching literal `+`), and for stars that follow closing parentheses or brackets (as in `)*` and `]*`). |
| `strictBrackets`      | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Throw an error if brackets, braces, or parens are imbalanced. |
| `strictSlashes`       | `boolean`      | `undefined` | When true, picomatch won't match trailing slashes with single stars. |
| `unescape`            | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Remove preceding backslashes from escaped glob characters before creating the regular expression to perform matches. |
| `unixify`             | `boolean`      | `undefined` | Alias for `posixSlashes`, for backwards compatitibility. |

## Options Examples

### options.basename

Allow glob patterns without slashes to match a file path based on its basename. Same behavior as [minimatch][] option `matchBase`.

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `false`

**Example**

```js
micromatch(['a/b.js', 'a/c.md'], '*.js');
//=> []

micromatch(['a/b.js', 'a/c.md'], '*.js', { basename: true });
//=> ['a/b.js']
```

### options.bash

Enabled by default, this option enforces bash-like behavior with stars immediately following a bracket expression. Bash bracket expressions are similar to regex character classes, but unlike regex, a star following a bracket expression **does not repeat the bracketed characters**. Instead, the star is treated the same as any other star.

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `true`

**Example**

```js
const files = ['abc', 'ajz'];
console.log(micromatch(files, '[a-c]*'));
//=> ['abc', 'ajz']

console.log(micromatch(files, '[a-c]*', { bash: false }));
```

### options.expandRange

**Type**: `function`

**Default**: `undefined`

Custom function for expanding ranges in brace patterns. The [fill-range][] library is ideal for this purpose, or you can use custom code to do whatever you need.

**Example**

The following example shows how to create a glob that matches a numeric folder name between `01` and `25`, with leading zeros.

```js
const fill = require('fill-range');
const regex = micromatch.makeRe('foo/{01..25}/bar', {
  expandRange(a, b) {
    return `(${fill(a, b, { toRegex: true })})`;
  }
});

console.log(regex)
//=> /^(?:foo\/((?:0[1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-5]))\/bar)$/

console.log(regex.test('foo/00/bar')) // false
console.log(regex.test('foo/01/bar')) // true
console.log(regex.test('foo/10/bar')) // true
console.log(regex.test('foo/22/bar')) // true
console.log(regex.test('foo/25/bar')) // true
console.log(regex.test('foo/26/bar')) // false
```


### options.format

**Type**: `function`

**Default**: `undefined`

Custom function for formatting strings before they're matched.

**Example**

```js
// strip leading './' from strings
const format = str => str.replace(/^\.\//, '');
const isMatch = picomatch('foo/*.js', { format });
console.log(isMatch('./foo/bar.js')) //=> true
```


### options.ignore

String or array of glob patterns to match files to ignore.

**Type**: `String|Array`

**Default**: `undefined`

```js
const isMatch = micromatch.matcher('*', { ignore: 'f*' });
console.log(isMatch('foo')) //=> false
console.log(isMatch('bar')) //=> true
console.log(isMatch('baz')) //=> true
```

### options.matchBase

Alias for [options.basename](#options-basename).


### options.noextglob

Disable extglob support, so that [extglobs](#extglobs) are regarded as literal characters.

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Examples**

```js
console.log(micromatch(['a/z', 'a/b', 'a/!(z)'], 'a/!(z)'));
//=> ['a/b', 'a/!(z)']

console.log(micromatch(['a/z', 'a/b', 'a/!(z)'], 'a/!(z)', { noextglob: true }));
//=> ['a/!(z)'] (matches only as literal characters)
```


### options.nonegate

Disallow negation (`!`) patterns, and treat leading `!` as a literal character to match.

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`


### options.noglobstar

Disable matching with globstars (`**`).

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

```js
micromatch(['a/b', 'a/b/c', 'a/b/c/d'], 'a/**');
//=> ['a/b', 'a/b/c', 'a/b/c/d']

micromatch(['a/b', 'a/b/c', 'a/b/c/d'], 'a/**', {noglobstar: true});
//=> ['a/b']
```

### options.nonull

Alias for [options.nullglob](#options-nullglob).


### options.nullglob

If `true`, when no matches are found the actual (arrayified) glob pattern is returned instead of an empty array. Same behavior as [minimatch][] option `nonull`.

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`


### options.onIgnore

```js
const onIgnore = ({ glob, regex, input, output }) => {
  console.log({ glob, regex, input, output });
  // { glob: '*', regex: /^(?:(?!\.)(?=.)[^\/]*?\/?)$/, input: 'foo', output: 'foo' }
};

const isMatch = micromatch.matcher('*', { onIgnore, ignore: 'f*' });
isMatch('foo');
isMatch('bar');
isMatch('baz');
```

### options.onMatch

```js
const onMatch = ({ glob, regex, input, output }) => {
  console.log({ input, output });
  // { input: 'some\\path', output: 'some/path' }
  // { input: 'some\\path', output: 'some/path' }
  // { input: 'some\\path', output: 'some/path' }
};

const isMatch = micromatch.matcher('**', { onMatch, posixSlashes: true });
isMatch('some\\path');
isMatch('some\\path');
isMatch('some\\path');
```

### options.onResult

```js
const onResult = ({ glob, regex, input, output }) => {
  console.log({ glob, regex, input, output });
};

const isMatch = micromatch('*', { onResult, ignore: 'f*' });
isMatch('foo');
isMatch('bar');
isMatch('baz');
```


### options.posixSlashes

Convert path separators on returned files to posix/unix-style forward slashes. Aliased as `unixify` for backwards compatibility.

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `true` on windows, `false` everywhere else.

**Example**

```js
console.log(micromatch.match(['a\\b\\c'], 'a/**'));
//=> ['a/b/c']

console.log(micromatch.match(['a\\b\\c'], { posixSlashes: false }));
//=> ['a\\b\\c']
```

### options.unescape

Remove backslashes from escaped glob characters before creating the regular expression to perform matches.

**Type**: `Boolean`

**Default**: `undefined`

**Example**

In this example we want to match a literal `*`:

```js
console.log(micromatch.match(['abc', 'a\\*c'], 'a\\*c'));
//=> ['a\\*c']

console.log(micromatch.match(['abc', 'a\\*c'], 'a\\*c', { unescape: true }));
//=> ['a*c']
```

## Extended globbing

Micromatch supports the following extended globbing features.

### Extglobs

Extended globbing, as described by the bash man page:

| **pattern** | **regex equivalent** | **description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `?(pattern)` | `(pattern)?` | Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns |
| `*(pattern)` | `(pattern)*` | Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns |
| `+(pattern)` | `(pattern)+` | Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns |
| `@(pattern)` | `(pattern)` <sup>*</sup> | Matches one of the given patterns |
| `!(pattern)` | N/A (equivalent regex is much more complicated) | Matches anything except one of the given patterns |

<sup><strong>*</strong></sup> Note that `@` isn't a regex character.

### Braces

Brace patterns can be used to match specific ranges or sets of characters.

**Example**

The pattern `{f,b}*/{1..3}/{b,q}*` would match any of following strings:

```
foo/1/bar
foo/2/bar
foo/3/bar
baz/1/qux
baz/2/qux
baz/3/qux
```

Visit [braces][] to see the full range of features and options related to brace expansion, or to create brace matching or expansion related issues.

### Regex character classes

Given the list: `['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js', 'd.js', 'E.js']`:

* `[ac].js`: matches both `a` and `c`, returning `['a.js', 'c.js']`
* `[b-d].js`: matches from `b` to `d`, returning `['b.js', 'c.js', 'd.js']`
* `a/[A-Z].js`: matches and uppercase letter, returning `['a/E.md']`

Learn about [regex character classes][charclass].

### Regex groups

Given `['a.js', 'b.js', 'c.js', 'd.js', 'E.js']`:

* `(a|c).js`: would match either `a` or `c`, returning `['a.js', 'c.js']`
* `(b|d).js`: would match either `b` or `d`, returning `['b.js', 'd.js']`
* `(b|[A-Z]).js`: would match either `b` or an uppercase letter, returning `['b.js', 'E.js']`

As with regex, parens can be nested, so patterns like `((a|b)|c)/b` will work. Although brace expansion might be friendlier to use, depending on preference.

### POSIX bracket expressions

POSIX brackets are intended to be more user-friendly than regex character classes. This of course is in the eye of the beholder.

**Example**

```js
console.log(micromatch.isMatch('a1', '[[:alpha:][:digit:]]')) //=> true
console.log(micromatch.isMatch('a1', '[[:alpha:][:alpha:]]')) //=> false
```

## Notes

### Bash 4.3 parity

Whenever possible matching behavior is based on behavior Bash 4.3, which is mostly consistent with minimatch.

However, it's suprising how many edge cases and rabbit holes there are with glob matching, and since there is no real glob specification, and micromatch is more accurate than both Bash and minimatch, there are cases where best-guesses were made for behavior. In a few cases where Bash had no answers, we used wildmatch (used by git) as a fallback.

### Backslashes

There is an important, notable difference between minimatch and micromatch _in regards to how backslashes are handled_ in glob patterns.

- Micromatch exclusively and explicitly reserves backslashes for escaping characters in a glob pattern, even on windows, which is consistent with bash behavior. _More importantly, unescaping globs can result in unsafe regular expressions_.
- Minimatch converts all backslashes to forward slashes, which means you can't use backslashes to escape any characters in your glob patterns.

We made this decision for micromatch for a couple of reasons:

- Consistency with bash conventions.
- Glob patterns are not filepaths. They are a type of [regular language][regular-language] that is converted to a JavaScript regular expression. Thus, when forward slashes are defined in a glob pattern, the resulting regular expression will match windows or POSIX path separators just fine.

**A note about joining paths to globs**

Note that when you pass something like `path.join('foo', '*')` to micromatch, you are creating a filepath and expecting it to still work as a glob pattern. This causes problems on windows, since the `path.sep` is `\\`.

In other words, since `\\` is reserved as an escape character in globs, on windows `path.join('foo', '*')` would result in `foo\\*`, which tells micromatch to match `*` as a literal character. This is the same behavior as bash.

To solve this, you might be inspired to do something like `'foo\\*'.replace(/\\/g, '/')`, but this causes another, potentially much more serious, problem.

All contributions are welcome! Please read [the contributing guide](.github/contributing.md) to get started.

**Bug reports**

Please create an issue if you encounter a bug or matching behavior that doesn't seem correct. If you find a matching-related issue, please:

- [research existing issues first](../../issues) (open and closed)
- visit the [GNU Bash documentation][bash] to see how Bash deals with the pattern
- visit the [minimatch][] documentation to cross-check expected behavior in node.js
- if all else fails, since there is no real specification for globs we will probably need to discuss expected behavior and decide how to resolve it. which means any detail you can provide to help with this discussion would be greatly appreciated.

**Platform issues**

It's important to us that micromatch work consistently on all platforms. If you encounter any platform-specific matching or path related issues, please let us know (pull requests are also greatly appreciated).
